# Simple Calci

## Description

This is a basic web-based calculator application with a graphical user interface. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage calculations. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Percentage Calculation**: Converts a number into a percentage.
- **Exponentiation**: Supports power calculations (`^`).
- **Backspace and Clear Functionality**: Users can delete the last input or reset the calculator.
- **Interactive UI**: Styled with CSS for a modern look and responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click on the number and operator buttons to form an expression.
3. Press `=` to evaluate the expression.
4. Use `C` to clear the input and `B` to delete the last character.

## How It Works

- User inputs are displayed dynamically.
- Operators and numbers are added to an expression string.
- The `eval()` function is used to compute the final result.
- The percentage button converts the last entered number into a percentage.
- Exponentiation (`^`) is implemented using `**` in JavaScript.
- Error handling prevents invalid expressions from crashing the app.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement keyboard support for input.
- Improve UI responsiveness for smaller screens.
- Enhance error handling for invalid expressions.
